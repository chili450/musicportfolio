    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m Om Chile and I love to produce music. I enjoy experimenting 
      with different drums, textures, and creating entire landscapes and vibes from the sounds I use. I started producing music in 9th grade and 
      now, I make beats in many different genres like hip hop, pop, and RnB.
      My goal is to blend technology with creativity to make something unique every time.

      <div class="track">
        <h3>Track 1: Evolve</h3>
        <span>This is the type of music that plays when the main character in a video game or a movie realizes they have to train to accomplish their goals, so they have a training/self-improvement phase. It gives the vibe of preparing for something to happen. This was created by combining acoustic drum sounds with a soft staccato string and bright and spacious synths, while including sudden stops in the piece to increase anticipation.</span><br/><br/>

      <div class="track">
        <h3>Track 2: Peace Before Dark</h3>
        <span>In this piece, I start with a calm R&B song created my layering pads and synths and adding acoustic RnB style drums (picture a bright orange sunset on a beach). The beat is then cooked in the microwave, and out comes an energetic, dark trap beat.</span><br/><br/>
        <audio controls src="beats/Peace before Dark.wav"></audio>
      </div>
      <div class="track">
        <h3>Track 3: Ascend</h3>
        <span>I put together a collection of calming synths and had their patterns give the vibe of ascension. As the song progresses, that feeling of ascension lingers until it all suddenly dissipates when the beat drops. Combining sophisticated synths and bells with trap and acoustic drum sounds provides a unique vibe.</span><br/><br/>
